# Task List: Safe Stroyka Program Improvements

## Task 1: Baseline Worktree Inventory

**Description:** Record the current repo state before implementation so generated artifacts and unrelated local files do not get mixed into feature work.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] `git status --short` is reviewed.
- [ ] Generated artifacts under `output/` and `graphify-out/` are excluded from implementation commits unless explicitly requested.
- [ ] Any existing untracked test files are classified as keep, stage, or ignore before code changes begin.

- [ ] Manual check: current worktree status is documented in the implementation note.

**Dependencies:** None

**Files likely touched:**
- None

**Estimated scope:** XS

## Task 2: Establish Validation Checklist

- [ ] Frontend test command is confirmed.
- [ ] Frontend build command is confirmed.
- [ ] Relevant smoke commands for the current slice are listed.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [x] Unauthorized behavior is intentional and documented.
- [x] Upload size and file-type checks are explicit.
- [x] Existing internal smeta import still works.

**Verification:**

- `ONBOARDING.md`

**Estimated scope:** S

## Task 4: Add Smeta Access Smoke

- [x] Requests include credentials by default.
- [x] Existing Bearer fallback still works during transition.
- [x] Logout/session-expired behavior remains clear to the user.

**Verification:**

## Task 6: CSRF Compatibility Slice

**Description:** Add a minimal CSRF design and first compatible server/client path for mutating requests without breaking current sessions.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [x] CSRF requirement is documented before broad enforcement.
- [x] One safe mutating endpoint proves the pattern: `/logout` has flag-gated CSRF checks for cookie sessions.
- [x] Public endpoints remain intentionally public.

**Verification:**
- [x] `CI=true npm test -- --watchAll=false`
- [x] `npm run build`
- [x] `PYTHONPYCACHEPREFIX=/tmp/stroyka-pycache python3 -m py_compile backend/main.py`
- [x] `PYTHONPYCACHEPREFIX=/tmp/stroyka-pycache python3 -m py_compile scripts/smoke-auth-session.py`
- [x] Production deploy passed `bash deploy.sh` at `340a91a` and production moved forward to `05e6354`.
- [x] `/csrf-token` is proxied by production nginx and returns `401` without a cookie session.
- [x] `EXPECT_CSRF_LOGOUT_ENFORCED=true npm run smoke:auth-session` passes on production.
- [x] Target endpoint accepts valid CSRF and rejects missing/invalid CSRF in live auth/session smoke.
